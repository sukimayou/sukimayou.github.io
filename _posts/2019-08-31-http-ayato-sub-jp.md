Today I archived the MIDI files from <http://ayato.sub.jp/> onto the Internet Archive, because no one did it yet, apparently. Most of the MUS, PDF and MUSX files are still not on there, so if someone could do those that would be great. The site is a bunch of scores of songs from mostly BEMANI rhythm games and some Touhou songs, and they&#8217;re done really well.

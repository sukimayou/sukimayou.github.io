just a quick guide:

  1. use MIDI Splitter Lite (<https://github.com/VirtuosicAI/MIDI-Splitter-Lite>) to split MIDI into tracks (you probably will need to check &#8220;Copy first track to output tracks&#8221;
  2. then go in Keppy&#8217;s MIDI Converter and load your soundfont it, drag all MIDIs in and export in whatever format you want (you might want to lower volume)

that should be it
